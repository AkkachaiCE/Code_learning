## What did you try? What worked well? What didn't work well? What did you notice?
In this traffic.py, I started the convolutional model as the as same as the recognition.py (the convolutional model that has been demonstrated in the class) then I try to run the model and found that the accuracy is very low even after done the 10 epochs of training it seems the accuracy still quite bad. Next, I tried to change some configurarion of the convolution of model such as the number of filter in convolutional layer, Add more hidden layers, change the sizes of hidden node of each layer and change some value of the dropout. Then I found that the accuracy result is very great (change from around 0.05 to 0.9). I think the most import factor of this change could be come from "the number of hidden layers" because after I add that value, I found the significant change!
